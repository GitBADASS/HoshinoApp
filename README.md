**🥀If we are always busy in school studying or always short of developer, this project would be deserted🏜.**

Now, it's main usage is to help user to learn English (after all we are only middle-school students, it seems that we actually need it XD).

In the future, it's usage will be changed into showing or posting somethings.

It is a JavaFX application of **Hoshino** (a private group set up by some students that post interesting things in a middle-school).

It is only a GUI now, we will create some interesting functions later. It will be used to facilitate the posting, commenting, discussing and so on.

If possible, web app or mobile app will come later.

- [ ] complete the function of setting a words warehouse
- [ ] complete the function of practicing words



**❓So, what is Hoshino in world?**

Only a private group. We some students set up it to post some interesting things at our school. We use paper to do so at first, later, we leant that we need a more convenient and multifunctional way. But we are short of developer, so web app will be developed later (you know, develop front and backend at the same time will spend a lot of time, as a student, we are  just right short of time).

**🥀如果我们始终缺少开发人员或者始终忙于在校的学习，这个项目或将被弃置🏜。**

本项目将会被开发去辅助用户的英语学习（有单词学习库等功能，或许作为的中学生我们真的需要它）

星夜社是一个由中学生建立的、主业为发布学校趣闻（~~或发一些牢骚~~）的团体。

星夜社应用程序目前只是一个GUI，后续会继续开发它的功能。

如果可能的话，我们会继续推出web程序和移动程序。
